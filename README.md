## My Process

### Built With

- **Vite**: A fast build tool and development server that provides an efficient development experience with rapid hot module replacement and optimized builds.
- **React**: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces, enabling component-based architecture and efficient rendering.
- **React Router v6**: A library for managing navigation and routing in React applications, helping to handle routes and render components based on URL paths.
- **Tailwind CSS**: A utility-first CSS framework that provides low-level utility classes to build custom designs quickly and consistently.
- **Redux Toolkit**: A library for managing application state with Redux, offering a streamlined approach to state management and reducing boilerplate code.
- **Axios**: A promise-based HTTP client for making requests to external APIs, providing a simple and intuitive API for handling network requests.
- **CSS Grid**: A powerful layout system in CSS for creating complex, responsive grid-based designs.
- **Flexbox**: A layout model in CSS that allows for the creation of flexible and responsive layouts with ease.
- **Mobile-First Workflow**: A design approach that prioritizes mobile device layouts and progressively enhances the experience for larger screens.

### What I Learned

During this project, I gained valuable experience and refined several skills:

- **Working with Vite**: Improved my proficiency in using Vite as a build tool and development server. Vite’s fast build times and modern development features were crucial in streamlining the development process and enhancing productivity.

- **API Integration**: Deepened my understanding of integrating and working with APIs. I learned how to effectively fetch and handle data from the REST Countries API, manage state, and display dynamic content.

- **CSS Grid Layout**: Improved my knowledge of CSS Grid for creating complex, responsive layouts. Leveraging Grid’s capabilities allowed me to design a flexible and adaptive interface that works well across different screen sizes.

### Continued Development

In future updates, I plan to focus on the following areas:

- **Add Animations**: Incorporate animations for the cards and hover effects to enhance user interaction and provide a more engaging visual experience. This could involve smooth transitions, scale effects, or other dynamic elements to make the interface feel more lively and responsive.

- **Refine Details**: Improve the overall design and user experience by refining details such as spacing, alignment, and visual consistency. This includes enhancing UI elements, optimizing responsiveness, and ensuring a polished and cohesive look throughout the application.

By focusing on these areas, I aim to elevate the project’s visual appeal and usability, making it more enjoyable and intuitive for users.
